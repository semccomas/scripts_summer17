readme file for scripts summer 2017

[finding_insects_ipython.py](https://github.com/semccomas/scripts_summer17/blob/master/finding_insects_ipython.py) searches the [speclist](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/speclist) at uniprot for
the insect taxonomy using [the insecta taxonomy group](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/?query=ancestor%3a50557) also from uniprot. This then finds the insects in the MSA file using the 'common
name' from the uniprot speclist and saves the output in the same format as the MSA file ('>blahblah \n alignment info)
